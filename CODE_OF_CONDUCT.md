# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to ensuring that everyone feels welcome and safe in our community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing our project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **[ayushchamoli.official@gmail.com]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: 
    - The project team will provide a written warning with an explanation of the violation. No further action will be taken if the behavior is corrected.
  
2. **Warning**: 
    - If a contributor engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, a warning will be issued. Continued violations after this warning will result in further action.

3. **Temporary Ban**: 
    - The contributor may be temporarily banned from the community for repeated violations, with a clear notice on how long the ban will last.

4. **Permanent Ban**: 
    - For severe violations or repeated offenses, the contributor may be permanently removed from the community and any related activities.
